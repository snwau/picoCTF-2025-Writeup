## Description ##

Welcome to the challenge! In this challenge, you will explore a web application and find an endpoint that exposes a file containing a hidden flag. 
The application is a simple blog website where you can read articles about various topics, including an article about API Documentation. Your goal is to explore the application and find the endpoint that generates files holding the serverâ€™s memory, where a secret flag is hidden. 
The website is running picoCTF News.

## Approach ##

Opening the `picoCTF News` challenge link in a browser and snooping around in the page source we see an interesting `href` for the `#API Documentation` tag:

    <!-- Message -->
    <div class="mb-4">
        <p class="text-gray-800">Explore backend development with us <a href="" class="text-blue-600">#nodejs</a> ,
            <a href="" class="text-blue-600">#swagger UI</a> , <a href="/api-docs" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">#API Documentation</a> 
        </p>
    </div>

Navigating to the `/api-docs` URL we see a list of API endpoints. Given the name of the challenge `head-dump` we see under the `Diagnosing` API section the `/heapdump` endpoint definition.

Expanding the entry for this endpoint we see a `Try it out` button, that exposes an 'Execute' button (as this endpoint takes no parameters to configure).

Submitting `Execute` results in a link to a `Download file` to download the response body.

Downloading the linked `Download file` we can then analyse its contents.

## Solution ##

A lot of data is in the downloaded response body, piping the contents to grep to search for the challenge flag locates the flag.

    $ cat ~/Downloads/heapdump-1741407700432.heapsnapshot | grep picoCTF{
    picoCTF{...........redacted.............}

Where the actual flag value has been redacted for the purposes of this write up.

## Description ##

Cookie Monster has hidden his top-secret cookie recipe somewhere on his website. As an aspiring cookie detective, your mission is to uncover this delectable secret. Can you outsmart Cookie Monster and find the hidden recipe? 
You can access the Cookie Monster here and good luck

## Approach ##

Opened the challenge link in the browser, `index.html` displayed username and password input fields for a Login form.

Using Firefox Web Developer Tools and submitting some dummy username and password entries a `POST` is made to `login.php`, with the response:

    Access Denied

    Cookie Monster says: 'Me no need password. Me just need cookies!'

    Hint: Have you checked your cookies lately?
    Go back

## Solution ##

Inspecting the "Storage > Cookies" within Firefox Web Developer Tools we see a `secret_recipe` cookie with contents:

    secret_recipe:"cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0U2MzRERkJCfQ%3D%3D"

Replacing the URL escaped characters `%3D` with the equivalent ASCII character `=` we can feed the contents of the cookie through `base64` to decode the flag:

    $ echo "cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0U2MzRERkJCfQ==" | base64 -d
    picoCTF{...........redacted.............}

Where the actual flag value has been redacted for the purposes of this write up.
